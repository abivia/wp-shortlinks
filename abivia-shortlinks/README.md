## Usage

### Creating Short Links

   - Destination URL(s) (one per line for rotation)
4. Optional: Enable rotation or set a password
5. Click "Create Short Link"

2. View all links with click counts

4. Export data as CSV when needed

### Managing Links
- Edit: Change destinations, rotation, or password
- Delete: Remove short links (with confirmation)
- Test: Verify your links work before sharing

## Advanced Features

### URL Rotation

When a short code has multiple destinations:
- Visitors get randomly redirected to one of the URLs
- All clicks are still tracked accurately
- Facilitates A/B (or A/B/C/D...) testing.

### Geo-targeting
Links can be set to apply only to specific regions based on an IP lookup.
To limit a link, add the geo-filter code in brackets before the target URL.

IP address lookups only performed when a link is geocoded.

### Password Protection
- Set a password when creating/editing links
- Visitors must enter password before redirect
- Works with both GET and POST requests

## Shortcodes

### Insert a short link

[short alias="code" text="link text" class="class"]

Only the alias is required. The text attribute overrides any text defined in the link.
If provided, the class is applied to the link.

### Insert a list of links

Useful when filtering links by geocode. Note that:
- Clicks are not tracked in this case.
- Link rotation does not apply. All matching links are listed.
 
[shortlist alias="code"]

Optional attributes:
- empty: text to display if all links are filtered by geocoding, an empty string if not provided.
- list_class: a class or classes to apply to the overall list (the \<ul> element). 
- item_class: a class or classes to apply to the list items (the \<li> elements).
- link_class: a class or classes to apply to the links (the \<a> elements).
- password: if the shortcode is password protected, a valid password must be supplied.

If there are errors, the "empty" text is displayed unless the current user has edit rights,
in which case an error message is shown.
